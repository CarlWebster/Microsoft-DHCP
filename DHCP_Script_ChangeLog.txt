#Version 1.42 17-Dec-2019
#	Fix Swedish Table of Contents (Thanks to Johan Kallio)
#		From 
#			'sv-'	{ 'Automatisk innehållsförteckning2'; Break }
#		To
#			'sv-'	{ 'Automatisk innehållsförteckn2'; Break }
#	Updated help text

#Version 1.41 8-Jan-2019
#	Cleaned up help text

#Version 1.40 5-Apr-2018
#	Added -AllDHCPServers (ALL) parameter to process all Authorized DHCP servers that are online

#	Code clean-up for most recommendations made by Visual Studio Code
#	Fixed several minor issues found during testing from the code cleanup
#	Grouped code into functions and functions into regions
#	In the Scope Options, if all Scope Options inherit from Server Options and the only 
#		scope option is the implied Option ID 51; then blank lines were inserted. This is now 
#		fixed so "None" is reported, just like all the other items. For some reason, Option ID 
#		51 is implied and even though it does not show in the console, the PowerShell cmdlet 
#		exposes it. If I try and retrieve the properties of that option, it can crash the computer 
#		running the script. Not a good thing if you are running the script on a DHCP server. I now 
#		check for this specific condition, and it is now handled properly for all output types.
#		Many thanks to my exhaustive tester, David McSpadden, for helping find and fix this logic flaw.
